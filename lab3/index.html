			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Redesign the homepage for our websites, create file structures, and learn how to link and reference to other files when coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The coding and file structures were fairly easy, I did not run into any problems regarding that. 
						At times I got frustrated with the CSS, but that was due to my overcomplication of the process.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I tried to perfect the layout and design of my homepage, but ended up getting myself in over my head with the CSS. 
						I had to take a stepback and realise that I am a beginner at coding, and won't be able to do all I wish immediately.  </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This page is the result of the work I did during this lab, below is a screenshot of my file structure:</p>

					<p>This lab also included designing our homepages. 
						If you're on this page you've probably already seen it, but here is a screenshot for good measure:</p>

					<p> Here is the HTML that shows how I made this page, as well as how I made my homepage</p>
