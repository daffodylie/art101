					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were asked to write our first JavaScript program, 
						which prints the make, model, color, year, and age of our cars.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Thankfully, I didn't have any issues with this lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I still feel a bit confused about how javaScript works, but I was able to get this lab finsihed without issue. 
						It seems that my understanding of the language will grow with time, but for now I am able to create simple scripts that I am proud of. </p>
