                <p>In this lab, we were asked to create a listener and an even.
                     In this case, a button that changed the styling when pressed.

            <div class="minor-section" id="problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had a difficult time getting my buttons to show up. I used the console, WesBot, and ChatGPT to troubleshoot.
                    In the end, the issue was that I had only linked my JS in the "head" and not the "body" of my HTML.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The results are the buttons you can see at the bottom of each section. 
                    Click on them and see what happens!</p>
