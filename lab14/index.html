					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Go through our past labs, find an issue, and debug it.</p>

					<h2>Debugging</h2>
					<p>I looked through my past labs to see if I could find any errors, and found that two of my buttons for lab 9 had broken.
						I believe it got messed up when I was trying to streamline my code for the bonus task.
						I did the following to diagnose the problem and fix it:

						<ol> 
							<li>Added console.log("Pressed") to the event listener, and clicked the buttons with the console open.
							This showed me that the second and third buttons were not connected to the listener.</li>
							<li>Looked over the code. Didn't see any obvious issues</li>
							<li>Consulted ChatGPT. It told me that the event listeners were selecting the buttons' ID, and that an ID can only be selected once.</li>
							<li>Changed the event listener to select the buttons' class</li>
							<li>Retried the buttons. They work now!</li>

						</ol>
