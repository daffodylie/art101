			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were asked to pseudocode an everyday task with our partner.
						Then, we pseudocoded Rock-Paper-Scissors, and turned that pseudocode into comments in javascript.
						Lastly, we edited this HTML file to reflect our efforts.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This was a pretty simple assignment, and pretty much everything worked without issue.
						The only problem I experienced was the inability to left-justify the javascript comments on this page.
						It isn't that big of a deal for it to be left-justied, so I'm fine to leave it as is. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I felt good about this assignment, and am looking forward to learning more about javascript in the coming weeks.
						It was fun to come up with the steps for Rock-Paper-Scissors with my partner Valarie. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<p> Here is our outline for brushing your teeth, incase you didn't know how to do it:</p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>Find a place with water</li>
						<li>Grab your toothbrush</li>
						<li>Run toothbrush under water</li>
						<li>Squeeze toothpaste onto toothbrush</li>
						<li>Brush your teeth</li> 
						<li>Rinse out your mouth</li>
					</ol>
					<p> Below is the pseudocode formatted to be javascript comments: </p>
						<pre><code>
							// Find one opponent
							// Print icons (rock, paper, and scissor buttons)
							// Prompt user selection with countdown
								// If not selection, computer chooses
							// Accept user input
							// Evaluate win, lose, tie
							  // Rock beats scissors 
							  // Scissors beat paper 
							  // Paper beats rock 
							  // Same icon prompts replay
						</code></pre>
