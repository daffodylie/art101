			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were asked to pseudocode an everyday task with our partner.
						Then, we pseudocoded Rock-Paper-Scissors, and turned that pseudocode into comments in javascript.
						Lastly, we edited this HTML file to reflect our efforts.

							// Find one opponent
							// Print icons (rock, paper, and scissor buttons)
							// Prompt user selection with countdown
								// If not selection, computer chooses
							// Accept user input
							// Evaluate win, lose, tie
							  // Rock beats scissors 
							  // Scissors beat paper 
							  // Paper beats rock 
							  // Same icon prompts replay
