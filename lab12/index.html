                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>In this lab, we were asked to experiment with DOM manipulation, 
                    and create a button that generates some randomized dialogue. 
                    I chose to have it write the first stanza of Edgar Allen Poe's "To Octavia."
                </p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="minor-section" id="problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>initially, I had a problem with dialogue not printing, 
                    but it turns out the issue was that I had missed a close-alligator sign.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The result is the button below. 
                    Click it and see what happens!</p>
