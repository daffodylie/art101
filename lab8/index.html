                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>In this lab, we were asked to experiement with anon functions and callbacks. 
                    I created a function that adds 5 to a number array, and an anon function that multiples by 5.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I struggled with the chrome console initially, getting different errors I didn't understand.
                    I asked by partner and wesbot and was able to sort it out.
                    I also had an issue with a syntax error, but it seems to show up no matter what I do.
                    Since the code is still running smoothly, I'll accept this defeat.
                </p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Below is the script output for the JavaScript function I wrote for this lab. 
                    You can also see it by opening the console on your Chrome browser.</p>
