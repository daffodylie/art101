                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>In this lab, we were asked to create a function with a window prompt asking the user to imput their name.
                    The function then scrambles that name and prints it.
                </p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>My function seems to be working properly and running smoothly, thankfully I didn't have many issues in the process.
                    However, there have been some circumstances in my life that made this lab difficult to complete.
