			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we were asked to create an array with our different modes of transportation, 
						an element with our primary mode, and a function that calculates age of our vehicles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some difficulty using the Chrome console, 
						because I was accidentally entering the code instead of going to the next line. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>While this assignment was simple, 
						I got frustrated when usign the console and that made the process more difficult.
						Everything is functioning and working, and I'm happy with the work I put in and the result I got out.  </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>

					<p>Part of the assignment was to create and style the HTML page you're looking at right now!
						Below is the output for the JavaScript program I wrote, and some screenshots showing my code. </p>
